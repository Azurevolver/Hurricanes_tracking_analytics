# Hurricanes tracking analytics

IS590 PR - Assignment 3
Instructor: Mr. Weible
Author: Yun-Hsuan Chuang (yhc4) Chien-Ju Chen (chienju2) Alan Chen (ycchen4)

This project aims to answer the following questions.

Question:
1. Compute and output the total distance the storm was tracked in nautical miles.
2. Calculate the speed in knots that the storm center moved, a.k.a “storm propagation” (from latitudes,
longitudes, and time lags) between data rows, but don’t output these details. Propagation is not derived from wind speed! From this series, compute and output maximum and mean (average) propagation speeds per storm in knots.
3. Make a function that takes any fixed point (latitude & longitude), supplied by the program user, and lists all storms that directly affected that location with hurricane-level winds (>=64kt). The location might represent a specific city or island or whatever.


Work Split:
All of the members discussed the requirements and wrote pseudo code together.
Based on Alan's assignment 1, Alan finished the functions for problem1,
Yun-Hsuan finished the functions for problem2, Chien-Ju and Alan finished the functions for problem3.
All of the members completed "process_storm_data" function together.
